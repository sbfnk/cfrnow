Real-time case fatality ratio (CFR) estimation from line-list data,
using a Bayesian mixture-cure survival model. `cfrnow` is registered as
an [epidist](https://epidist.epinowcast.org/) model type, so the CFR and
the onset-to-death delay both take `brms` formulas. You can put
covariates (or a time-varying effect) on either.

## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub with
[pak](https://pak.r-lib.org/):

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("sbfnk/cfrnow")
```

`pak` pulls in the packages `cfrnow` builds on
([epidist](https://epidist.epinowcast.org/),
[brms](https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/),
[primarycensored](https://primarycensored.epinowcast.org/) and
[distspec](https://epiforecasts.io/distspec/)), including the GitHub
versions it needs.

Fitting runs through CmdStan, so you also need
[cmdstanr](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) and a CmdStan install:

``` r
# install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://stan-dev.r-universe.dev", getOption("repos")))
cmdstanr::check_cmdstan_toolchain()
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

## Why

The naive `deaths / cases` ratio runs low in real time, because recent
cases have not had time to die yet. Switching to *resolved* cases,
`deaths / (deaths + recoveries)`, overshoots the other way: deaths
resolve faster than recoveries, so the resolved set is top-heavy with
deaths.

`cfrnow` conditions on neither. Each case is fatal with probability
`cfr`; a fatal case dies after an interval-censored onset-to-death delay
`F`; and a case still unresolved at the cut-off is right-censored,
contributing `1 - cfr * F(t)` (it is either non-fatal or fatal but not
yet resolved). Hold `F` fixed and you recover the Ghani/Nishiura
estimator ([Ghani et al. 2005](https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwi230);
[Nishiura et al. 2009](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006852));
here the model co-estimates `F` and carries its uncertainty through.
Give it recovery dates and the two-outcome fit uses onset-to-recovery
timing as well.
[primarycensored](https://primarycensored.epinowcast.org/) handles the
onset interval-censoring and the real-time right-truncation of `F`.

## Usage

``` r
library(cfrnow)
#> Loading required package: distspec
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'distspec'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     Gamma, sd

# your own onset_date / death_date line list, or a simulated one
set.seed(1)
ll <- simulate_linelist(
  n = 400, cfr = 0.55, onset_days = 45,
  delay = Gamma(mean = 12.75, sd = 7)
)
d <- prepare_cfr_data(ll, obs_time = as.Date("2026-02-20"))
c(cases = d$n_cases, deaths = d$n_deaths, censored = d$n_cens)
#>    cases   deaths censored 
#>      400      180      220
```

Supply the onset-to-death `delay` and a `cfr_prior` as
[distspec](https://epiforecasts.io/distspec/) distributions. A native
delay parameter can be a `Normal()` prior (co-estimated) or a fixed
number (held fixed; fixing the whole delay gives the Ghani/Nishiura
estimator). The `cfr_prior` is a `Beta()` and matters because the CFR is
weakly identified early on: `Beta(1, 1)` is uniform, `Beta(1, 9)`
favours a low CFR, and `Beta(6.6, 13.4)` (mean 0.33) suits a
high-fatality pathogen.

``` r
onset_to_death <- LogNormal(meanlog = Normal(2.41, 0.2), sdlog = Normal(0.51, 0.15))
fit <- fit_cfr(d, delay = onset_to_death, cfr_prior = Beta(1, 1))
summary(fit)
#>     quantity   mean   q2.5    q50  q97.5  rhat ess_bulk
#> 1        cfr  0.560  0.505  0.560  0.615 1.001     3100
#> 2 delay_mean 12.700 11.600 12.700 13.900 1.000     3300
#> 3   delay_sd  7.100  6.200  7.000  8.200 1.000     3000
```

Swap the family, fix the delay, or add recovery timing. And because the
model is fitted through `epidist`, you can put covariates (or a smooth
on time) on the CFR via a `formula`:

``` r
fit_cfr(d, delay = Gamma(shape = Normal(3, 1), rate = Normal(0.25, 0.1))) # gamma
fit_cfr(d, delay = LogNormal(meanlog = 2.41, sdlog = 0.51)) # fixed-F
fit_cfr(d,
  delay = onset_to_death,
  recovery_delay = LogNormal(Normal(2.9, 0.3), Normal(0.5, 0.2))
) # two-outcome

# covariate / time-varying CFR: carry the column through the prep, then
# reference it in the formula (the onset date rides along as `onset`).
dc <- prepare_cfr_data(ll, obs_time = as.Date("2026-02-20"), covariates = "age_group")
fit_cfr(dc, delay = onset_to_death, formula = brms::bf(mu ~ 1, cfr ~ age_group))
```

Pass `obs_time = NULL` to `prepare_cfr_data()` for a retrospective fit
(it reduces to the naive ratio with the delay as a nuisance).

Your line list needs `onset_date` and `death_date` (`NA` for cases that
have not died). Optional `onset_lower`/`onset_upper` widen the onset
censoring, and a `recovery_date` column switches on the two-outcome fit
that also times recoveries. `summary()` reports `rhat`/`ess_bulk` (and
`recovery_mean`/`_sd` when recoveries are used) and flags
`cfr_low_information` when the CFR posterior has barely moved from its
prior, which is expected early on, when the estimate is prior-driven.

## Assumptions and caveats

The correction fixes a *timing* bias; it cannot repair the data. Worth
reading before you quote a number:

- Deaths need to be ascertained completely. A death that never reaches
  the line list (a community death outside a treatment centre, say)
  looks like a survivor and drags the CFR down. This is the main worry
  wherever ascertainment is centred on treatment centres.
- Put the death *notification* date in `death_date`, not the true date
  of death. A case counts as a death once its `death_date` is on or
  before the cut-off, so the notification date lets the censoring absorb
  any reporting lag and keeps `cfr` correct. The delay the model then
  works with is onset-to-notification, so read `delay_mean`/`delay_sd`
  (and any biological delay prior) in that light. With no reporting lag,
  plain death dates are fine.
- The delay and CFR are taken as stationary and homogeneous unless you
  say otherwise: one delay and one CFR for the whole outbreak. Put a
  formula on `cfr` (a smooth on time, say) to let it vary.
- The delay family is a modelling choice, not something the fit learns.
  Gamma and lognormal differ in tail weight (how fast a recent case
  counts as “probably cured”), and sparse data can’t tell them apart, so
  refit with the other one to check sensitivity.
- Recovery timing leans on complete discharge data. In the two-outcome
  fit a case that really recovered but whose recovery went unrecorded
  stays censored and drifts toward the fatal branch over time, biasing
  `cfr` *up*. The death-only default (no `recovery_date`) sidesteps
  this, so prefer it where discharge recording is patchy.

## Roadmap

The main remaining gap is a death-reporting-delay nowcasting layer for
the case denominator, to handle cases that are under-ascertained or
reported late. Posterior-predictive checks (`pp_check_cfr()`) and richer
delay structure (covariates on the delay, a separate recovery family)
are now in place.
