# Build model inputs from a line list

Classifies each case at an observation cut-off into an observed death
(with an interval-censored onset-to-death delay), a resolved non-death,
or a right-censored survivor still unresolved at the cut-off, and
returns the pieces
[`fit_cfr()`](https://sbfnk.github.io/cfrnow/reference/fit_cfr.md)
passes to Stan. A case counts as resolved non-death if it has a
`recovery_date` on or before the cut-off (or, in a retrospective fit, if
it simply never died); such a case contributes the cure term rather than
being censored, so recording recoveries tightens the estimate.

## Usage

``` r
prepare_cfr_data(
  linelist,
  obs_time = NULL,
  covariates = character(),
  t0 = NULL,
  max_delay = 60
)
```

## Arguments

- linelist:

  A data frame with an `onset_date` column, an optional
  `onset_lower`/`onset_upper` onset window, a `death_date` column (`NA`
  for cases that have not died; use the date the death was notified,
  i.e. when it entered the data, so real-time censoring absorbs any
  reporting lag), and an optional `recovery_date` column (`NA` unless
  the case is a recorded non-fatal recovery). Dates may be `Date` or
  coercible.

- obs_time:

  Real-time cut-off (`Date` or coercible), or `NULL` for a retrospective
  fit in which every recorded death counts and survivors are treated as
  fully resolved. In real time, a case with a recovery on or before
  `obs_time` is resolved; one still alive and unresolved is
  right-censored; and a death dated after `obs_time` is treated as
  not-yet-known (right-censored).

- covariates:

  Character vector of `linelist` column names to carry through to the
  per-case model rows, so they can be used in a `cfr ~ ...` formula. The
  onset date is always carried as `onset`; for a time-varying CFR derive
  a time term from it (e.g. `week`) and pass `cfr ~ s(week)`.

- t0:

  Optional time origin (`Date`). Defaults to `min(onset) - max_delay`.

- max_delay:

  Plausibility filter for data-entry errors, in days: a death record
  implying a negative onset-to-death delay, or one longer than
  `max_delay`, is dropped as a likely mis-keyed date. This only screens
  records; it does **not** bound or truncate the onset-to-death delay
  the model fits, so set it comfortably above the longest credible delay
  to avoid discarding genuine long-delay deaths (which would bias the
  delay short). It also sets the default origin,
  `t0 = min(onset) - max_delay`.

## Value

A `cfrnow_data` list with the aggregated model inputs (`n_death`,
`death_delay`, `death_width`, `n_recovery`, `recovery_delay`,
`recovery_width`, `n_cens`, `censor_time`, `censor_width`, `n_resolved`,
`n_cases`, `n_deaths`, `n_recoveries`, `t0`, `obs_time`) and a `cases`
data frame with one row per kept case (`y`, `outcome`, `pwindow`,
`swindow`, `onset` and any requested `covariates`), which
[`as_epidist_cure_model()`](https://sbfnk.github.io/cfrnow/reference/as_epidist_cure_model.md)
turns into the model frame.

## Details

Onset is taken over the day-window `[onset_lower, onset_upper]` when
those columns are present (defaulting to a one-day window at
`onset_date`). Deaths and recoveries are recorded to the day.

Records that cannot be used are dropped with a warning: a missing onset,
an inverted onset window (`onset_upper < onset_lower`), a death with an
impossible onset-to-death delay (negative, or longer than `max_delay`),
or a recovery dated before onset. In real time, cases whose onset falls
after `obs_time` are not yet known and are excluded with a message.

## Examples

``` r
ll <- simulate_linelist(n = 50, delay = LogNormal(2.4, 0.5))
prepare_cfr_data(ll, obs_time = as.Date("2026-02-01"))
