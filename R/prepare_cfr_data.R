#' Build model inputs from a line list
#'
#' Classifies each case at an observation cut-off into an observed death (with
#' an interval-censored onset-to-death delay), a resolved non-death, or a
#' right-censored survivor still unresolved at the cut-off, and returns the
#' pieces [fit_cfr()] passes to Stan. A case counts as resolved non-death if it
#' has a `recovery_date` on or before the cut-off (or, in a retrospective fit,
#' if it simply never died); such a case contributes the cure term rather than
#' being censored, so recording recoveries tightens the estimate.
#'
#' Onset is taken over the day-window `[onset_lower, onset_upper]` when those
#' columns are present (defaulting to a one-day window at `onset_date`). Deaths
#' and recoveries are recorded to the day.
#'
#' Records that cannot be used are dropped with a warning: a missing onset, an
#' inverted onset window (`onset_upper < onset_lower`), a death with an
#' impossible onset-to-death delay (negative, or longer than `max_delay`), or a
#' recovery dated before onset. In real time, cases whose onset falls after
#' `obs_time` are not yet known and are excluded with a message.
#'
#' @param linelist A data frame with an `onset_date` column, an optional
#'   `onset_lower`/`onset_upper` onset window, a `death_date` column (`NA` for
#'   cases that have not died; use the date the death was notified, i.e. when it
#'   entered the data, so real-time censoring absorbs any reporting lag), and an
#'   optional
#'   `recovery_date` column (`NA` unless the case is a recorded non-fatal
#'   recovery). Dates may be `Date` or coercible.
#' @param obs_time Real-time cut-off (`Date` or coercible), or `NULL` for a
#'   retrospective fit in which every recorded death counts and survivors are
#'   treated as fully resolved. In real time, a case with a recovery on or
#'   before `obs_time` is resolved; one still alive and unresolved is
#'   right-censored; and a death dated after `obs_time` is treated as
#'   not-yet-known (right-censored).
#' @param t0 Optional time origin (`Date`). Defaults to
#'   `min(onset) - max_delay`.
#' @param max_delay Plausibility filter for data-entry errors, in days: a death
#'   record implying a negative onset-to-death delay, or one longer than
#'   `max_delay`, is dropped as a likely mis-keyed date. This screens records; it
#'   does **not** bound or truncate the onset-to-death delay the model fits, so
#'   set it comfortably above the longest credible delay to avoid discarding
#'   genuine long-delay deaths (which would bias the delay short). It also sets
#'   the default time origin, `t0 = min(onset) - max_delay`.
#'
#' @return A `cfrnow_data` list with the Stan inputs (`n_death`, `death_delay`,
#'   `death_width`, `n_recovery`, `recovery_delay`, `recovery_width`, `n_cens`,
#'   `censor_time`, `censor_width`, `n_resolved`) plus `n_cases`, `n_deaths`,
#'   `n_recoveries`, `t0` and `obs_time`.
