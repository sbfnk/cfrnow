# Precompute the time-varying CFR demonstration used in the vignette.

# The vignette cannot run Stan at build time (no CmdStan on the builder), so we
# fit here, save the recovered cfr(week) posterior summary alongside the known
# true curve, and let the vignette read the cached result and plot it.

# Run from the package root with CmdStan available:
